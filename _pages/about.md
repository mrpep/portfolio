👋 👋 👋 I’m a computer science 💻 PhD candidate at Universidad de Buenos Aires 🇦🇷

I am working in the intersection of deep learning 🧠 and audio 🔊, particularly speech 🗣, music 🎼 and environmental sounds.

My PhD topic is self-supervised audio representation learning for general sound understanding. I have worked in other audio and deep learning related topics such as:

- Emotion recognition from speech.
- Neural audio codecs.
- Text to speech synthesis and voice cloning.
- Music source separation.
- Wakeword detection.
- NLP and textless NLP.

In my free time I like making music 🎸 and travelling/hiking 🌍 🏞️
