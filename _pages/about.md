👋 👋 👋 I’m a PhD candidate in computer science 💻 at the Universidad de Buenos Aires 🇦🇷 working at the intersection of deep learning 🧠 and audio 🔊.

My research focuses on self-supervised audio representation learning for general sound understanding. I'm particularly interested in:

- Representation Learning.
- Emotion recognition from speech.
- Neural audio codecs.
- Text to speech synthesis and voice cloning.
- Music source separation.
- Wakeword detection.
- NLP and textless NLP.

I also enjoy making music 🎸 and exploring the outdoors through travel and hiking 🌍 🏞️
