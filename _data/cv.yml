        - My project is titled "New deep learning strategies for general sound understanding"
        - Supervised by Dr. Luciana Ferrer and co-supervised by Dr. Pablo Riera.
        - The main idea of the project is to design a reusable deep learning model for general audio tasks, which can be used for transfer learning in low-resource scenarios. I am adapting transformer models to deal with audio signals, and exploring different pretext tasks to pretrain this kind of models.
